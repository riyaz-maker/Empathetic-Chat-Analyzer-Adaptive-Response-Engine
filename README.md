# Empathetic-Chat-Analyzer-Adaptive-Response-Engine
A microservice that is built using sentiment analysis and emotion detection using Gemini and RoBERTa-base. This service would analyze user inputs in real time, gauge emotional states, and adapt responses to better match the userâ€™s mood.
## Features
### Automatic Emotion Detection:
Uses a fine-tuned transformer model to classify user messages into emotions.

### Adaptive Response Generation:
Integrates Gemini 2.0 Flash API to generate responses tailored to the detected emotion.

### Real-Time Interaction:
Provides both RESTful and WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication.

### Scalable & Modular:
Developed with FastAPI for a clean, modular architecture.

## Technology Used
### Deployment:
Uvicorn for ASGI server, compatible with local and cloud environments.

### LLMs & NLP:
Hugging Face Transformers for emotion detection (using a fine-tuned classification model).
Google Gemini API 2.0 Flash for generating empathetic, context-aware responses.

### Tunneling (for remote development):
ngrok for exposing local servers (when using Google Colab).

## LLM & Gemini Integration
This project leverages two components:

### Emotion Detection via Transformers:
A fine-tuned RoBERTa-base emotion classifier (based on a transformer model) is used to detect the user's emotional state from their message.

### Response Generation with Gemini API:
The Gemini 2.0 Flash API from Google is used for generating natural, empathetic responses based on dynamic prompt templates.
